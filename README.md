### What we are providing üòá
---

- We eliminate the existence of the middle agency, thereby completely removing the regulation of salaries of drivers by corporations. So, the earnings of the driver are solely dependent on the number of rides he/she makes. 
- All the data is stored on the peer-to-peer decentralized Polygon Matic Chain. This not only ensures complete security, but also a lightning-fast experience. Data privacy is maintained by the access specifiers of data members and methods defined in the smart contracts. 
- We are not only eliminating the middle man, the L2 solution by Polygon gives us a boost in transaction rate. It is also a known fact that data transfer is faster in a mesh network.
- We have implemented a smart contract addressing the issue of storing critical data necessary at different stages of Taxi Hailing and making it verifiable by all stakeholders in dRyver.

### Prerequisites
---
- Nodejs v9.10 or above
- Truffle v4.1.8 (core: 4.1.8) (http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation)

### Deployment Steps:
---

#### Smart contracts

Steps to Execute Solidity Smart Contract using Remix IDE

Remix IDE is generally used to compile and run Solidity smart contracts. Below are the steps for the compilation, execution, and debugging of the smart contract. 
 

Step 1: First clone our GitHub project from here. Open Remix IDE on any of your browsers, Choose solidity as the environment.
```
git clone https://github.com/NakamotoSans/Contracts
cd Contracts
```
Step 2:Import the contracts from your local system. Click the Compile button under the Compiler window to compile the contract.
Step 3: To execute the code, click on the Deploy button under the Deploy and Run Transactions window.
Step 4: After deploying the code click on the method calls under the drop-down of deployed contracts to run the program, and for output, check to click on the drop-down on the console.
Step 5: For debugging click on the Debug button corresponding to the method call in the console. Here you can check each function call and variable assignment.

#### Mobile Application

Step 1: Make sure you have the development environment is setup for [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
Step 2: Clone our Application GitHub repo
```
git clone https://github.com/NakamotoSans/Application
cd Application
```
Step 3: Install all the dependencies
```
yarn install //recommended
```
or
```
npm install
```
Step 4: Start the Metro

```
npx react-native start
```

Step 5: Run the Application
```
npx react-native run-android
```
